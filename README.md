## Introduction
The problem we are investigating is whether it is possible to transfer music style from one genre of music to another. We have come to realize that that there are many ways of transferring style, from dynamics (how the volume changes over time) to rhythm (tempo of the music) to pitch (music scores differences). Our work drew inspiration from this [paper] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03535.pdf), which attempts to learn the dynamics of classical and jazz piano pieces. We expand upon their investigations of learning the dynamics of a piece. Later, we would like to investigate whether we can learn tempo information as well as other more complex information such as instrument changes and note correlations.
